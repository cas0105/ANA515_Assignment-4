# Assignment 4 - Data Analytics Project
# For this project, I used the credit card fraud dataset found on Kaggle to create a model for predicting fraudulent credit card transactions. I followed the code of a project found at this url https://data-flair.training/blogs/data-science-machine-learning-project-credit-card-fraud-detection/
# This repository includes a r markdown file and the pdf output of the markdown file to present the data analytics problem and project.
